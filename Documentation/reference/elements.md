# Elements

The 27 kinds of the [Kit](../guides/kit.md), with the fields each one takes on top of the [fields every element takes](../guides/kit.md#fields-every-element-takes) (the click fields `onClick`, `menu`, `shortcut` and `link` are listed there apart, for `button`, `secure`, `icon`, `slot` and `handle`), its callbacks and its methods. Create them with `container:Add(kind, fields)` or `api:Create(kind, parent, fields)`.

Sizes marked "the skin's" come from the player's skin; the value given is the one of the default skin. A **unit** is the skin's `page.unit`, 170 pixels by default.

The fields are checked when the element is created: a value of the wrong type, an unknown name (a `frame` that is not `flat`, `small` or `large`, a `color` that is not a palette name), a number out of range (`step` of 0 or less, `min` not below `max`, `columns` below 1) or a `name` already used by a live frame raises `EbonAPI: MyAddon: ...` at the line of your call. `onClick`, `menu` and `shortcut` on a kind that does not list them raise `element "text" does not handle onClick` (`menu` is also accepted on `list`, `tree` and `table`; `link` is accepted everywhere). `disabled` on a kind that cannot be greyed (`heading`, `text`, `status`, `bar`, `grid`, `group`, `panel`, `tabs`) raises `element "text" cannot be disabled`. A `hidden` or `disabled` function that returns `nil` means visible, enabled.

A callback field of an element is called with the element first; the callbacks and functions of an item or a row start with the item or the row, as their signatures show. An error it raises is reported to the game's error display without breaking the element. A field that accepts a function (such as `get`, `items` or `text`) calls it again at every refresh; see [Refreshing](../guides/kit.md#refreshing).

The examples on this page add their elements to `win`, a window created with `api:Window`. They show their texts through `key` and these translations:

```lua
api:Locale({
  enUS = {
    ROUTES = "Routes",
    BUILDS = "Builds",
    NO_ROUTE = "No route yet",
    ROUTE = "Route",
    ASHES = "Ashes",
    NEXT_RESET = "Next reset: %s",
    NO_ITEM = "Nothing to show",
    RESET_DONE = "Reset!",
    CLOSED = "Closed this week",
  },
  frFR = {
    ROUTES = "Routes",
    BUILDS = "Builds",
    NO_ROUTE = "Aucune route pour le moment",
    ROUTE = "Route",
    ASHES = "Cendres",
    NEXT_RESET = "Prochaine réinitialisation : %s",
    NO_ITEM = "Rien à afficher",
    RESET_DONE = "Réinitialisation terminée !",
    CLOSED = "Fermée cette semaine",
  },
})
```

## Actions

### button

A button with a text. Its width follows the text unless you give `width`.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `minWidth` | the smallest width |

`onClick(element, mouseButton)` receives `"LeftButton"` or `"RightButton"`; with a `menu`, the right-click opens the menu instead.

### secure

A button that casts a spell, uses an item or runs a macro when the player clicks it with the left button. `onClick` is still called after a click; with a `menu`, the right-click opens the menu instead.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `spell`, `item` or `macro` | the action: a spell name, an item name, or the text of a macro |
| `name` | a global name for the button, so that a macro can `/click` it: letters, digits or `_`; a name already held by a live frame or by a global of another addon raises an error |
| `preClick` | `function(element, mouseButton)`, called just before the action |
| `disabled` | greys the button and blocks the action |
| `minWidth` | the smallest width |

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetDisabledState(disabled)` | nothing | greys the button and blocks the action, or restores it; during combat the change waits for the end of the fight |
| `element:SetAction({ spell = ... })` | the element | another action, with `macro`, `spell` or `item` (strings); if the table holds several, the macro wins, then the spell, then the item; an empty macro counts as none; a table with none of them removes the action; during combat the change waits for the end of the fight |

`SetAction` with `nil` or anything but a table raises `EbonAPI: MyAddon: SetAction expects a table with macro, spell or item, got nil`. A secure element may be created without any action.

A secure element cannot be created during combat: the call raises `EbonAPI: MyAddon: a secure element cannot be created during combat`. See [Combat](../guides/kit.md#combat).

### icon

A square icon, with a count, a cooldown and a checked state. With `spell`, `item` or `macro`, it becomes a secure button like [secure](#secure), with the same `name` and `preClick` fields; it cannot be created during combat either.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `icon` | a question mark | a name from `Interface\Icons` or a texture path, or a function that returns it |
| `size` | the skin's, 32 | width and height |
| `count` | | a text or number in the lower right corner; `nil` clears it |
| `checked` | | `true` highlights the border, `false` removes the highlight; a function that returns `nil` removes it too |
| `cooldown` | | `{ start, duration }`, as `GetSpellCooldown` returns them; `{ 0, 0 }` hides it; a function that returns `nil` hides it too |

A fixed `checked` or `cooldown` is read at the first refresh only; after that, `SetCheckedState` and `SetCooldown` decide. A function is read again at every refresh.

The border changes color when the mouse is over the icon and when it is checked.

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetCooldown(start, duration)` | the element | shows a cooldown; a `start` or a `duration` of 0 hides it |
| `element:SetCheckedState(state)` | the element | highlights the border or not |
| `element:SetDisabledState(disabled)` | nothing | greys the icon and makes it fainter |
| `element:SetAction(action)` | the element | another action, for a secure icon; same rules as [secure](#secure); on an icon without `macro`, `spell` or `item` it raises `element "icon" is not secure, give it macro, spell or item to accept SetAction` |

### shortcut

A button that lets the player choose the key of a [keyboard shortcut](../guides/kit.md#keyboard-shortcuts). Its text is the key, or `label: key` when you give `text` or `key`; it reads **None** while no key is chosen and **Press a key...** while it waits.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `target` | required: the id of the shortcut, the one given as `shortcut` to the element to click; without it the call raises `shortcut expects a target, the shortcut name of the element it binds, got nil` |
| `text`, `key` | a label before the key |
| `minWidth` | the smallest width |

A click waits for a key, a right-click removes the key, **Esc** cancels. The modifier keys **Shift**, **Ctrl** and **Alt** alone do not count: hold them while you press the key, and the shortcut is saved as, for example, `ALT-CTRL-K`. The tooltip reads "Click, then press the key to use. Right-click removes it."

## Values

Each value element reads its value from `get`, a function called at every refresh, or starts with `value`. It tells you about a change through `onChange`, only when the player changes it: changing the value from your code does not call `onChange`. `text` or `key` is its label.

### toggle

A check box with its label.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `get`, `value` | `true` or `false` |
| `onChange` | `function(element, value)` |

### range

A slider with a number field.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `min`, `max` | `0`, `1` | the bounds |
| `step` | `1` when `max - min` is 10 or more, else `0.01` | the increment |
| `percent` | | `true` shows the value as a percentage |
| `format` | | `function(value)` returning the text shown; if it raises, the error is reported and the number is shown |
| `get`, `value` | `min` | the value |
| `onChange` | | `function(element, value)`, when the player releases the slider or types a number and presses **Enter** |
| `width` | one unit | |

The value is rounded to `step` and kept between `min` and `max`. `onChange` is not called when the value did not change. A number typed in the field may use a comma, and a `%` sign is ignored; **Esc** puts the previous value back.

### select

A drop-down list.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `values` | a table `{ key = text }`, shown sorted by text (equal texts by key), or a list shown in its order, or a function that returns one of them. A list holds strings (each is the key and the text) or `{ value = ..., text = ... }` items; `textKey` can replace `text`, in the table form too; an item without text shows its key |
| `get`, `value` | the key chosen |
| `onChange` | `function(element, key)` |
| `width` | one unit by default |

### color

A color swatch with its label. A click opens the game's color picker.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `get`, `value` | a list of four numbers from 0 to 1: red, green, blue and opacity, such as `{ 1, 0.5, 0, 1 }`; a `get` that returns `false` is not replaced by `value` |
| `alpha` | `true` lets the player choose the opacity too; without it, the picker has no opacity slider |
| `onChange` | `function(element, r, g, b, a)` |

### input

A text field with a title.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `lines` | a number of lines above 1: the field becomes multi-line and scrolls |
| `get`, `value` | the text |
| `onChange` | `function(element, text)` |
| `width` | one unit by default |

A one-line field calls `onChange` on **Enter**; **Esc** puts the previous text back. A multi-line field calls it when it loses the focus; **Enter** goes to the next line. `onChange` is not called when the text did not change.

## Text

### heading

A title line across the content, two units wide by default. It takes `text` or `key`.

### text

A paragraph.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | `"small"` | `"small"`, `"medium"` or `"large"` |
| `color` | the text color | a palette name |
| `width` | two units | the text wraps at this width |

### status

A [text](#text) in the muted color, for a secondary line. Same fields.

### timer

A countdown. Its text shows the time left, rounded up to whole seconds, such as `1h 2m`, `3m 5s` or `45s`.

```lua
local reset = win:Add("timer", {
  key = "NEXT_RESET",
  onDone = function(element) api:Print(api:L().RESET_DONE) end,
})
reset:Start(90)
```

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text`, `key` | | a label: with `%s`, the time replaces it, otherwise it follows the label; `%%` shows one `%`, and any other `%` is shown as written |
| `size` | the skin's, `"small"` | as for [text](#text) |
| `color` | | a palette name |
| `width` | one unit | |
| `onDone` | | `function(element)`, when the time is up |

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:Start(seconds, onDone?)` | the element | starts the countdown, or restarts it; the text updates at once; `onDone(element)` runs once when it ends, before the `onDone` field; a `Start` without a function keeps the one of the previous `Start` until the countdown ends or is stopped |
| `element:Stop()` | the element | stops it and forgets the function given to `Start` |
| `element:Remaining()` | a number | the seconds left, `0` when stopped |

## Containers

A container has the methods `Add`, `Clear`, `Children`, `SetOrientation` and `Layout` of a window, and the fields `layout`, `spacing`, `columns` and `wrap`, read again at every layout. `SetOrientation(direction)` takes `VERTICAL`, `HORIZONTAL`, `GRID`, `FLOW` or `NONE`; anything else raises `SetOrientation expects VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL, GRID, FLOW or NONE, got x`. `Clear` also removes the shortcuts and stops the timers of the elements it removes; removed secure elements are hidden after combat. See [Windows](../guides/kit.md#windows) and [Layouts](../guides/kit.md#layouts). The `tabs` element is not itself a container: add elements to the pages that `AddTab` returns.

### bar

Elements side by side. Its size fits its content unless you give `width` or `height`.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `frame` | a frame around it: `"LARGE"`, `"SMALL"` or `"FLAT"`, in any case |
| `padding` | the margin inside the frame, the skin's by default (8 with a frame, 0 without) |

### grid

A [bar](#bar) that places its elements in rows of `columns`, 4 by default. Each column is as wide as its widest element. `columns` is a whole number, 1 or more.

### group

A titled box. Its title is `text` or `key`. It takes `scroll`, with `width` and `height` for the visible part; `height` also applies without scroll.

### panel

A box that the player folds and unfolds by clicking its title, which is `text` or `key`.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `expanded` | `true` | unfolded at first |
| `onToggle` | | `function(element, expanded)`, when the player or `SetExpanded` folds or unfolds it |
| `scroll` | `"NONE"` | see [Scrolling](../guides/kit.md#scrolling) |
| `height` | | the height, also without scroll |

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetExpanded(state)` | the element | folds or unfolds it; with the state it already has, it does nothing and `onToggle` is not called; during combat, if it holds a secure element, it waits for the end of the fight |

### tabs

A row of tabs, each with its own page. The element is as wide as its widest page and as high as the strip plus the page shown, unless you give `width` or `height`.

```lua
local tabs = win:Add("tabs", { onSelect = function(element, id) api:Debug("tab " .. id) end })
local routes = tabs:AddTab("routes", { key = "ROUTES" })

routes:Add("text", { key = "NO_ROUTE" })
tabs:AddTab("builds", { key = "BUILDS" })
```

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:AddTab(id, fields)` | the page, a container | adds a tab; `id` is a string or a number, and one already used raises `AddTab id "x" is already used`; `fields` takes `text` or `key` for its label (the id by default), `hidden` (`true`, `false` or a function) and the fields of a container, `width` and `height` included |
| `element:Select(id)` | the element | shows that tab; an unknown id does nothing; during combat, if the tabs hold a secure element, it waits for the end of the fight |
| `element:Selected()` | the id | the id of the tab shown, `nil` without tabs |

`onSelect(element, id)` is called every time a tab is chosen, by the player or by `Select`, even when it is already shown. The first tab added is shown first. A tab with `hidden` shows neither its button nor its page, and `Select` cannot choose it; `hidden` is read again at every `AddTab`, `Select` and refresh.

## Collections

### list

Rows that the player selects, checks, drags, or right-clicks. Two units wide and 200 pixels high by default; it scrolls.

```lua
win:Add("list", {
  emptyKey = "NO_ITEM",
  items = {
    { text = "Frostfire", checked = true },
    { text = "Ashfall", checked = false, tip = api:L().CLOSED },
  },
  onSelect = function(element, item) api:Print(item.text) end,
  onCheck = function(element, item, checked) api:Print(item.text, checked) end,
})
```

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `items` | the list of items, or a function that returns it; a list is read at the first refresh only, a function at every refresh |
| `rowHeight` | the height of a row, the skin's by default (20) |
| `empty`, `emptyKey` | the text shown when there is no item; `emptyKey` is a key of your translations |
| `menu` | the menu of a right-click on an item: a list, or `function(item)` that returns one; an error in the function is reported and the click goes on as a normal click; a disabled item has no menu |
| `drag` | `function(item)` returning what the item carries when dragged; `nil` or `false` means it cannot be dragged; if it raises, the error is reported and only that item cannot be dragged |
| `onSelect` | `function(element, item, mouseButton)`, after a click on an item that is not disabled; not called when the right-click opened a menu |
| `onCheck` | `function(element, item, checked)` |
| `onDrop` | see [Drag and drop](../guides/kit.md#drag-and-drop) |
| `width`, `height` | two units by 200 pixels by default |

| Item field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `text`, `key` | the label |
| `color` | a palette name for the label; any other name raises `EbonAPI: MyAddon: list item color "x" is not a palette color (known: ...)`, at creation and in `SetItems` or `SetNodes`, before anything is stored |
| `checked` | `true` or `false` shows a check box before the label; the list writes the new value back into the item |
| `disabled` | `true` greys the item and ignores its clicks |
| `tip` | the tooltip text of the row |
| `menu` | the menu of a right-click on this item, instead of the list's |
| `drag` | what this item carries when dragged, instead of the list's |
| `onClick` | `function(item, mouseButton)`, called before `onSelect` |
| `onCheck` | `function(item, checked)`, called before the list's `onCheck` |

The list keeps the selection while the same item table is still in the list. When you give new items, a selected item that is gone is replaced by the first new item that shows the same line (the same key text, else the same text), or nothing is selected. The list writes nothing into your item tables except `checked`, so the same tables can feed a list and a tree.

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetItems(items)` | the element | new items; `nil` empties the list; a refresh does not undo them |
| `element:Selected()` | the item | the item selected, your own table, or `nil` |
| `element:Select(item)` | the element | selects an item (`nil` clears the selection); does not call `onSelect` |

### tree

A [list](#list) whose items hold other items. Same fields, same methods; its items also take:

| Item field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `children` | the list of items under this one |
| `expanded` | `true` shows them at first; the tree keeps the state itself and does not write it into the item |

A click on an item that has children opens or closes it, and selects it. With no menu, a right-click does the same as a left-click. `element:SetNodes(items)` gives new items, like `SetItems`.

### table

Rows under column headers. A click on a header sorts the rows; a second click reverses the order. Three units wide and 200 pixels high by default; it scrolls.

```lua
win:Add("table", {
  columns = {
    { id = "name", key = "ROUTE" },
    { id = "ashes", key = "ASHES", width = 60, align = "RIGHT" },
  },
  rows = {
    { name = "Frostfire", ashes = 1200 },
    { name = "Ashfall", ashes = 850 },
  },
  onSelect = function(element, row) api:Print(row.name) end,
})
```

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `columns` | the list of columns, set when the table is created: `id`, `text` or `key` for the header (the id by default), `width`, `align` (`"LEFT"`, `"CENTER"`, `"RIGHT"`), `sort = false` to keep a column from sorting |
| `rows` | the list of rows, or a function that returns it; a list is read at the first refresh only, a function at every refresh; each row holds one value per column `id` |
| `menu` | the menu of a right-click on a row: a list, or `function(row)` that returns one; an error in it is reported and the click goes on as a normal click |
| `onSelect` | `function(element, row, mouseButton)` |
| `width`, `height` | three units by 200 pixels by default |

A row may also hold `tip` (the tooltip text, titled with the first cell), `menu` (instead of the table's) and `onClick(row, mouseButton)`, called before `onSelect`. Columns without `width` share the room left, at least 20 pixels each. Values that can be read as numbers come first and sort as numbers; the others follow, as text without regard to case; equal rows keep the order of `rows`, in both directions. When you give new rows, the selected row is replaced by the first new row with the same text in every column, or nothing is selected. A right-click on a row that has a menu opens the menu and does not select the row.

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetRows(rows)` | the element | new rows; `nil` empties the table |
| `element:SortBy(id)` | the element | sorts by a column; the same id again reverses the order |
| `element:Sorted()` | a list | a copy of the rows in the order shown |
| `element:Selected()` | the row | the row selected, your own table, or `nil` |

## Display

### progress

A bar that fills from left to right, with its text in the middle. One unit wide and 14 pixels high by default.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value`, `max` | `0`, `1` | the amount, or functions that return it; a number is read at the first refresh only, a function at every refresh |
| `color` | the skin's | a palette name for the fill |
| `text`, `key` | | the text in the middle |
| `width`, `height` | | the size |

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetValue(value, max?)` | the element | sets the amount; an invalid `max` keeps the previous maximum; an invalid `value` gives 0 |

The fill is the share `value / max`, kept between empty and full.

### chart

Bars from left to right, scaled to the largest value. Two units wide and 60 pixels high by default.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `values` | a list of numbers, or a function that returns it; a list is read at the first refresh only, a function at every refresh |
| `color` | a palette name for the bars |
| `width`, `height` | the size |

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetValues(values)` | the element | draws new values; `nil` draws none |

### arrow

An arrow that points to a place on the map, or in a fixed direction, with a text under it.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | the skin's, 48 | width and height |
| `color` | `"heading"` | a palette name |
| `text`, `key` | | the text under the arrow |

| Method | Returns | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element:SetTarget(x, y)` | the element | points to a position on the current map, from 0 to 1 as `GetPlayerMapPosition` gives it; follows the player as they move and turn |
| `element:SetAngle(radians)` | the element | points in a fixed direction; `0` is the arrow as drawn |
| `element:ClearTarget()` | the element | hides the arrow |

The arrow is hidden at creation and while it has no target, after `SetTarget(nil)` or `ClearTarget`; `SetTarget` with a target, or `SetAngle`, shows it. With `SetTarget`, the arrow hides while the player's position on the map is unknown.

### model

A 3D model that the player turns by dragging and zooms with the mouse wheel; the skin sets the turning speed and the zoom limits. Dragging stops when the player releases the mouse button, even outside the model.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unit` | | a unit, such as `"player"` or `"target"`, or a function that returns it |
| `creature` | | a creature id, or a function that returns it |
| `model` | | a model file, or a function that returns it |
| `dress` | | `true` gives a model that can wear items, like the dressing room |
| `width`, `height` | the skin's, 160 by 220 | |

## Moving things

### slot

A row with an optional icon that can be dragged and that receives what is dropped on it. One unit wide and 24 pixels high by default.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `text`, `key` | the label |
| `icon` | an icon before the text: a name from `Interface\Icons` or a texture path, or a function that returns it; it appears at the first refresh where it is not `nil` |
| `drag` | what the slot carries when dragged, or a function that returns it; `nil` or `false` means it cannot be dragged |
| `onDrop` | `function(element, payload, source, item)` when another element of your addon is dropped on it; the same four arguments when the player drops a spell or an item carried on the cursor, with `payload` the `{ kind, id, detail }` of the cursor and `source` and `item` `nil`; see [Drag and drop](../guides/kit.md#drag-and-drop) |
| `width`, `height` | the size |

### handle

A round grip. Dragging it with the left button moves the window that holds it, unless the window's `move` is `"NONE"`. The player's **Lock positions** still applies, and a window that holds a secure element does not move during combat.

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | the skin's, 12 | width and height |
