# EbonAPI for addon developers

**The shared foundation of Ebonhold addons: server, players, data, language and interface.**

EbonAPI 1.0.0 · World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (Interface 30300) · Lua 5.1

EbonAPI is an addon that other addons build on. It does, once and for all of them, what every Ebonhold addon would otherwise rewrite: read what the server sends, talk to the other players, save data, follow the player's language, draw windows and settings, announce updates, and help you find what went wrong. Your addon asks for a **handle** and reaches every service through it.

These pages are written for developers. Players should read the [addon README on GitHub](https://github.com/Siphelis/EbonAPI#readme) instead.

## Conventions

- `api` always means the handle returned by `EbonAPI:NewAddon`.
- `MyAddon` is the example addon. Replace it with your own name.
- A code block with a file name above it goes in that file. The others are excerpts: they expect `api` to exist already.
- Callouts mark what matters:

!!! note
    A rule worth knowing before you write the next line.

!!! tip "🎮 Try it"
    Where to see the result in game, in the EbonAPI window.

!!! warning
    A trap that breaks your addon if you miss it.
